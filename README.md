This repository contains the code for my personal web developer portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and learning journey. 
The portfolio features a clean, responsive layout built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and includes sections such as a Hero, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. 
It highlights my expertise in front-end development, WordPress, and the LAMP stack, with a timeline showcasing my educational progress. 
Additionally, the site is optimized for social media sharing with integrated Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags, and includes smooth scroll functionality for easy navigation.
The portfolio serves as both a professional introduction and a demonstration of my web development abilities.
